Senior Capstone group project.

Intended simply to example programming experience. While it should build, the app wouldn't do anything as the backend server is no longer online.

Project is relatively unchanged other than having
1) scrubbed the files of personal information as well as removed git history, as I've not gotten authorization from team members to expose their data; and
2) clearly distinguished the files I owned by moving source files owned by other team members to a Team folder.

The objective of the project was to enable an employee to confidently represent any product during public engagement. The app enabled this by providing product browsing/search and then retrieving selected product details.
